# About

**_RBTools_** is a NodeJS module with classes to manipulate several Rock Band-related files on all available systems. **_RBTools_** also uses _Python_ to manipulate many kinds of files, like image and texture files. The main exports of this package consists on classes that represents a file type to be processed. All secondary methods used on these classes is also available to import from `rbtools/lib`.

# Installation

## Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Python v3 & PIP](https://www.python.org/downloads/): **_RBTools_** uses _Python scripts_ to manipulate many kinds of files, like image and texture files.

## Installation steps

Follow the steps below to install and set up the project on your local machine:

- Install Python v3 with PIP.

- Execute the `scripts/install_python_packages.py` script to install necessary Python packages:

```bash
python scripts/install_python_packages.py
```

- Clone the repository: If you have `git` installed, se the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash

```

- Install project dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
npm install

_Make sure that the `packages` folder are in the project's root folder to install all packages correctly. The reason for this is because there are some packages that is made by me and they're not uploaded to the NPM server, existing only locally._

- Config your environment file (OPTIONAL): Create a `env` file in the root of where you downloaded/cloned this repository and put these values:

  - `RBTOOLS_BIN_PATH`: Changes the path used as the `bin` directory path for the module. Default is the module `dist/bin`.
